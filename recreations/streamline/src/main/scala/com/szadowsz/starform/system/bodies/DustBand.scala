/**
  * Class to represent a band of dust of gas. Contains the inner and outer edge, and whether it has dust or
  * gas present.
  *
  * @note Most implementations that I have the source for use an internal linked-list structure to maintain the list of
  *       bands. I have chosen to disregard this choice in scala in order to use scala's robust lambda feature set. In
  *       any case this class can be extended to accommodate the internal structure.
